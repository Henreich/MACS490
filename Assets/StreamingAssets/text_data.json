            "Text": "The quokka,the only member of the genus Setonix, is a small macropod about the size of a domestic cat. Like other marsupials in the macropod family (such as kangaroos and wallabies), the quokka is herbivorous and mainly nocturnal. Quokkas are found on some smaller islands off the coast of Western Australia, particularly Rottnest Island, just off Perth, and also Bald Island near Albany, and in isolated scattered populations in forest and coastal heath between Perth and Albany. A small colony exists at the eastern limit of their range in a protected area of Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve, where they co-exist with the critically endangered\r\nGilbert's potoroo. The quokka has little fear of humans, and it is common for quokkas to approach people closely, particularly on Rottnest Island where there is a prevalent population of them. It is, however, illegal for members of the public to handle the animals in any way, and feeding, particularly of \"human food\", is especially discouraged as they can easily get sick. An infringement notice carrying a A$300 fine can be issued by the Rottnest Island Authority for such an offence. \r\nThe maximum penalty for animal cruelty is a $50,000 fine and a five-year prison sentence. Quokkas can also be observed at several zoos and wildlife parks around Australia; some examples include Perth Zoo, Sydney's Taronga Zoo and Wildlife Sydney Zoo, and Adelaide Zoo. Physical interaction is generally not permitted without explicit permission from supervising staff"
