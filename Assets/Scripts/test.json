            "Text": "The quokka is the only member of the
genus Setonix, is a small macropod about the size of a domestic cat.

Like other marsupials in the macropod family (such as kangaroos and
wallabies), the quokka is herbivorous and mainly nocturnal.

Quokkas are found on some smaller islands off the coast of Western
Australia, particularly Rottnest Island, just off Perth, and also Bald
Island near Albany, and in isolated scattered populations in forest and
coastal heath between Perth and Albany. A small colony exists at the
eastern limit of their range in a protected area of Two Peoples Bay
Nature Reserve, where they co-exist with the critically endangered
Gilbert's potoroo.
